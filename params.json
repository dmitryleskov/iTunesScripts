{"name":"iTunesScripts","tagline":"iTunes for Windows Automation Scripts by Dmitry Leskov","body":"This is the home of my iTunes for Windows automation scripts that I share with the world hoping that other people may find them useful.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have published one script called **AddFLACs**, which imports FLAC audio files into iTunes in Apple lossless format.\r\n\r\n**Quick Start:** **[download the latest binary release](https://github.com/dmitryleskov/iTunesScripts/releases)** and **[watch a screencast](http://screencast.com/t/peQrVyuYZf)** of the most straightforward usage scenario.\r\n\r\nIf it works for you, consider **[sending me a Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/dmitryleskov/)**. Otherwise, **[check if it is a known issue](https://github.com/dmitryleskov/iTunesScripts/issues/)**.\r\n\r\n# News #\r\n\r\n**14-Jul-2013**: [Version 0.93](https://github.com/dmitryleskov/iTunesScripts/releases/tag/v0.93) released, fixing a crash on metadata-less FLACs.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# AddFLACs #\r\n\r\n## NAME ##\r\n\r\nAddFLACs - add FLAC files to the iTunes media library\r\n\r\n## SYNOPSIS ##\r\n\r\n`AddFLACs [ FOLDER ]`\r\n\r\n## DESCRIPTION ##\r\n\r\nThe **AddFLACs** script scans the specified *FOLDER* and its subfolders\r\nfor FLAC files, converts them to Apple lossless format and adds to the\r\niTunes library.\r\n\r\nTo avoid track duplication, **AddFLACs** first extracts the metadata from\r\neach FLAC file it encounters and checks if a track with *exactly* the \r\nsame artist, album and title is already present in the iTunes library.\r\nSuch tracks will be skipped *even if they are in a different format*.\r\n\r\nIf *FOLDER* is not specified, the current folder and its subfolders \r\nwill be scanned.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites ###\r\n\r\n* FLAC command-line utilities, **flac.exe** and **metaflac.exe**, and\r\na UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion helper must be present in the folder \r\ncontaining the script.\r\n\r\n* All FLAC files must be properly tagged prior to conversion. At a minimum, \r\nthe tags ARTIST, ALBUM, and TITLE must be present. Also recognized are GENRE, \r\nTRACKNUMBER, DATE, and COMPILATION. \r\n\r\n* If the DATE tag is present, it must contain year only.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE ##\r\n\r\nThe **AddFLACs** script and the Unicode conversion helper are released under\r\nthe MIT/X11 license (see **COPYING.MIT**.)\r\n\r\nThe FLAC command-line tools are released under the GPLv2 (see **COPYING.GPL**.)\r\nThe source code may be obtained from \r\n[the official FLAC pages on SourceForge](http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html).\r\n\r\n## SEE ALSO ##\r\n\r\n[Vorbis Comments](http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
